<p > 
My name is Simon, I have been in staying in Auckland for four years studing.
 I left my full-time Telecommunications job of four years
 to pursue a career in Information Communications and Technology.
 I have finished studying and have gained a Diploma in IT Software Development Level 6. 
 I am looking for an opportunity to show my passion for all things digital and gain experience in the tech industry.
 I love learning new technologies and picking up new skills and am always looking to learn more, know more, do more!
The four years working had taught me things like being a team player,how to interact with customers, helping train new collegues on processes,
 how to fix basic hardware issues, how to use CRM systems, log service requests and tickets,
 cashing up at the end of the day, opening the store, 
stocking items in, order products and providing excellent service for all customers. 
however I have a desire to understand whats under the hood of the tech that we use.

<p >
My current part time job where I travel to different locations has given me a chance to show that I can work autonomously. 
I have had my full New Zealand driversâ€™ licence since 2012 and I own a private vehicle.
Given the opportunity, 
I am determined to offer the best and most reliable service possible to boost the rapport between all customers and your company.
